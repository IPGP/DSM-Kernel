## single station and event example

### Overview
This example demonstrates the two central steps of this code:

1. the computation of a database of Green functions for a specified region of the Earth.
2. the computation of a kernel using the previously computed database

### Instructions
#### The Green function database
To compute the database you need the two programs SGTpsv and SGTsh that
compute the databases necessary for PSV and SH waves, respectively. The sources
of these codes are stored in `DSM-Kernel/src/SGTpsv/` and `DSM-Kernel/src/SGTsh/`.

<!---
##### Compilation

1. `./configure` and `make`
2. if you want to change FCFLAGS, please do `./configure FCFLAGS='...'`

-->

##### Configuration and Execution
1. copy the file `database.inf` to `my_database.inf`. In this file:
 * adjust the paths (first path in the file with the path of your DSM-Kernel installation)
 * adjust the output directory path (second), where the database is stored.
   The database needs some disk space. Make sure to have ~2-3 Gb free.
 * you can adjust the remaining parameters that control e.g. frequency range,
   domain size and sampling of the database. In particular chose the source depth
   for which you want to compute the database!
2. submit the command `mpirun -np 256  ../../bin/mpiSGTpsv < ./database.inf`
   to compute the psv database. Select the number of processors that you want to use
   with the -np parameter (256 in this example). `run_database.slurm` shows an
   example script that submits this process to the IPGP cluster malbec.
3. check if there were any errors. The subfolders in [mydatabase] should
   be full of files (be careful, typing `ls` will take some time)

#### Kernel Calculation
3. check that there were no errors and that you can find the binaries:
   `DSM-Kernel/bin/mpiKernelMaker`.

#### Configuration and Execution
1. copy the file `kernel.inf` to `my_kernel.inf`. In this file:
 * adjust the directory `[xy]` to point to your DSM-Kernels installation
 * check out the other parameters that are used to control the source, filters
   and other parameters. The time window controls for which phase you compute
   the sensitivity kernel. The time window, source depth and source-station distance
   have to correspond or be within the ranges specified
   in the database configuration file (`database.inf`).
2. make sure that the output directory that you specified has an empty subdirectoy
   called `log`. (e.g. output/log/)
3. submit the command `mpirun -tmi -np 128 ../../bin/mpiKernelMaker < ./kernel.inf`
4. check if there were errors. If not, the output directory should contain
   files named: `eq.Explosion.Z.Z.5471000` up to `eq.Explosion.Z.Z.6371000` that
   contain a slice of the kernel at one particular depth.

#### Visualization
This program provides several visualisation tools. the basic visualisation
tools are useful to examine the datastructure of the output files and how
they can be read. Note that `python3.5` with `numpy` and `matplotlib` is required
to run these scripts. For more advanced plotting, you can convert the kernels
to vtk files to view and plot them e.g. with `paraview` or `mayaview`.

##### basic 3D plotting
1. check out and run the python script `multiplekernel_write_vtk.py kernel.inf`. You need the
   python module `pyevtk` for this (e.g. `pip install pyevtk`). The script saves a
   file `kernel.vts` in the example directory that can be opened and visualized
   with paraview.
