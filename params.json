It consists of forward and back propagated strain Green's function calculation in a 2D plane, cross correlations of forward and back propagated wavefields to obtain sensitivity kernels. We developed also visualisation facilities of kernels. Those who would like to get kernels by comparing observed and synthetic waveforms, we developed python interface for that purpose as well. All the main motors are parallelised and you just have to submit prepared scripts. \r\n\r\n## Programmes inside DSM Kernel Suite\r\nDSM Kernel Suite have five independent programmes for each step. If you fetch the application's source with git, this dependency will be fetched automatically. \r\n* SGTpsv : Green's function calculation for PSV mode (MPI fortran, NF) \r\n* SGTsh  : Green's function calculation for SH  mode (MPI fortran, NF)\r\n* wave2kernel : visualisation of SAC files in order to compare them with synthetics and to decide which phase (python, HJ)\r\n* KernelMaker : 3D Fréchet derivatives calculation (MPI fortran, NF)\r\n* KernelViewer : 3D Kernel visualisation facilities (python, MM)\r\n\r\nrecommended requirements:\r\n* ifort\r\n\r\noptional requirements:\r\n* obspy\r\n* VTK\r\n\r\n## Build and Install\r\n* Make SGTpsv, SGTsh, KernelMaker by configuring `etc/config_calcul/config.h` (compiler options etc.) \r\n* Further information will be available in ...\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n * [single station and event](examples/single_kernel/README.md)\r\n * [multiple stations and events](examples/multiple_kernels/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Kernel Gallery\r\n<img src=\"etc/images/kernel1.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n\r\n## Papers to be cited\r\nFuji, N., Chevrot, S., Zhao, L., Geller, R.J., Kawai, K.
