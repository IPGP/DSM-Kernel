DW mantle bulk composition from Taylor 2013, 10.1016/j.chemer.2013.09.00

EH45 mantle bulk composition from Sanloup et al. 1999, 10.1016/S0031-9201(98)00175-7

Hot and cold temperature profiles are calculated by Ana Plesa. Plesa et al. 2015, 10.1002/2014JE004748

Thermoelastic properties are computed from the bulk mantle composition and temperature profiles with Perple_X.
The thermodynamic database and solution models are based on Stixrude et al. 2011, doi: 10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04890.x: stx11ver.dat, stx11_solution_model.dat and the Gt_maj model is used for the garnet-majorite mineral.

The calculation of the internal structure models follows Rivoldini et al. 2011, 10.1016/j.icarus.2011.03.024, and the details about the thermodynamic liquid core model is in Dumberry et al. 2015, 10.1016/j.icarus.2014.10.038. The core model assumes liquid Fe-S.

Attenuation factor Q_Kappa = 57 822 for the whole interior and Q_mu = 143 for the mantle + core / 600 for the crust (PREM values and constant relative to frequency).

All models agree with the MOI and k2 estimate of Konopliv et al. 2016, 10.1016/j.icarus.2016.02.052

Crust model 1:
Specifications of the crust:
- two layers of about same thickness
- upper layer: density = 2600kg/m^3, vP = 5400+700 (m/s)/kbar*0.1 kbar/km*depth
- lower layer:  density = 2900kg/m^3, vP = 6600+500 (m/s)/kbar*0.1 kbar/km*depth
- both layers:  vS = vP/Sqrt[3].


Crust model 2:
Specifications of the crust:
- two layers
- top layer: about 1/4 of the thickness of crust
- top layer (basaltic dense layer): density = 3100kg/m^3
- bottom layer: density = 2800 kg/m^3 
 

Bedrock and regolith:
The crust of model is 90 km and comprises an 80 m InSight EDR subsurface model and a 1km thick bedrock layer. 
The density of the bedrock layer is 2300 kg/m3, and the velocities are 2700 m/s (VP) and 1500 m/s (VS).
